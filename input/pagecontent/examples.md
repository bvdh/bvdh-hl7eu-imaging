This section illustrates the way imaging reports can be created using these IG's. The following examples are included:

1. Imaging report with the minimal amount of structured data
2. An imaging report generated from HL7v2 messages.
3. An imaging report with structured and unstructured elements.
4. An imaging report exploring many of the strucutured data elements.

Please note that these examples illustrate the way this IG can be used to create imaging reports. What approach is valid (and allowed) is not covered by this IG and requires further guidance.
